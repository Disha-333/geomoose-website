-----------------------------------------------------------
We are exited to announce that the GeoMOOSE project has graduated from 
OSGeo incubation.

4/6/2013 - Come see us at FOSS4G-NA 2013
---------------------------------------- 

Come visit us at `FOSS4G-NA 2013 <http://foss4g-na.org>`_ in Minneapolis, MN
from May 21-24.  GeoMOOSE started in Minnesota and was first presented in very
early form at OSG '05.  As OSG '05 was a precursor to the FOSS4G conferences,
we feel FOSS4G-NA 2013 is a homecoming for the project.  There will be a
`GeoMOOSE workshop <https://m360.mngislis.org/event/session.aspx?id=86848>`_
(presented as part of the `MN GIS/LIS Consortium's spring workshops
<https://m360.mngislis.org/event.aspx?eventID=76603>`_) in the afternoon on May
21st.  GeoMOOSE developers will be  attending the conference and we plan to
grab a table at the code sprint on Friday the 24th.  Friday is a free day, so
even if you can't attend the rest of the conference, stop by and see us during
the code sprint. Also, be sure to check out the other projects at the sprint
and the free presentations.
