3.0 Development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Development on a fresh new GeoMOOSE 3.0 is getting really exciting! We've put together a great new architecture while working hard to keep GeoMOOSE familiar to users and administrators.  Check out the activity on `GitHub <https://github.com/geomoose/gm3>`_ and the new `Demo <http://demo.geomoose.org/3.0/demo/>`_.

GeoMOOSE will be at FOSS4G 2017 in Boston!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new GeoMOOSE 3.0 workshop will be presented in Boston! If you're coming to Boston, sign up, and learn the new GeoMOOSE!  The workshop will cover the new concepts, installation, and customization of 3.0.  We are waiting on pins-and-needles in order to hear about our project status presentation.  If that's accepted we'll post here with more information.

4/5/2017 - GeoMOOSE Security Advisory
-------------------------------------

A security issue in GeoMoose was identified that affects many  versions of GeoMoose.  The earliest version of the bug we have been able to identify is GeoMoose 2.7 but earlier versions of the 2.X series may also be affected. 

The fix for this is easy and works the same for all versions of GeoMoose.  Find your copy of "download.php" and replace it with this one:

- https://github.com/geomoose/geomoose-services/raw/master/php/download.php

This version has been tested and does not exhibit the bug.

*Please* update your GeoMoose installations as soon as possible.

All packages now available have been fixed. 

Thank You,

The GeoMOOSE Team
