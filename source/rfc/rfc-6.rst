Summary
-----------

Keeping the GeoMOOSE project lively requires that we need to explore multiple funding options.  While professional services have always been available they are not always the most accessible way for users to contribute to the project.  Given that not all users are techncial or have the time to contribute directly to project works, adding a funding agent and mechanism for taking small donations would allow more to people to contribute to the project.

Implementation Tasks
-----------------------

1. The PSC will select a funding agent via the RFC process.  
   This will let the PSC have a public record of who is handling the funds as they are recieved.

2. Expenditure history will be tracked on a Git repository available to the PSC.

3. All expenditures from incoming funds must be approved by a simple majority of the PSC.

4. The PSC chair will be responsible for reporting funding balance at regularly PSC meetings.

5. Creation of online services and advertisement on the GeoMoose website.
   After the funding agent and donation mechanism has been approved by the PSC, the website
   should be updated to link users in that direction.
