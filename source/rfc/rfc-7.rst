RFC 7: GeoMOOSE 3.0
====================================================================

:Last Updated: 13 March 2017


Summary
-----------

The web browser and the Javascript ecology has been evolving all around GeoMOOSE! 
In keeping with those changes, GeoMOOSE 3.0 will require a major rewrite to both stay
relevant with the new generation of web technologies and to help extend its reach
and functionality.

Goals
-----

1. Exercise Standards instead of Custom Services.  Previous version of GeoMOOSE used Perl and PHP in order to provide query services for the user.  3.0 strives to use WMS and WFS standards in order to work with existing service's capabilities.
2. Use a recognizeable Javascript development stack.  This includes using contemporary Javascript package management and structuring the project in a way that is compatible with the modern Javascript toolchain.
3. Make upgrades easier on users.  Upgrading between even small revisions of GeoMoose has previously been a huge pain point for implemntation.
4. Keep installations simple.  Users should not need to know a specific Javascript library or require heavy coding in order to create their own GeoMOOSE deployment.


Implementation Tasks
-----------------------

1. Creation of new repositories dedicated to GeoMOOSE 3 development.

2. Selection of underlaying Javascript libraries for implementation.

3. Code, code, code!
