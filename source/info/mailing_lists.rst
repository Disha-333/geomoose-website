Mailing Lists
=============

The GeoMoose Users mailing list is the best way to contact GeoMoose developers and other users for help.  Developers regularly follow the mailing list and try to assist users in as immediate fashion as possible.

We encourage anyone who is interested in GeoMoose to join the mailing list to ask questions or just to stay informed.  Please follow `this link <http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/geomoose-users>`_ for information on signing up for the geomoose-users mailing list.

There is also a GeoMoose PSC mailing list which is used by GeoMoose project steering committee members for project administrative purposes that wouldn't be of interest to users.

The mailing list archives are available from OSGeo.
  * `geomoose-users <https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/geomoose-users/>`_

The mailing list archives are also searchable on `Nabble <http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/GeoMoose-f5002154.html>`_
