GeoMoose Quickstart Guides

----

Want to try GeoMoose on Windows without a lot of setup? Then checkout the `MS4W Quickstart. <https://theduckylittle.github.io/gm3/ms4w-quickstart/index.html>`_ It will walk you through installing MS4W and the GeoMoose MS4W package.


Developer Quickstart
--------------------

*This version of the quickstart assumes use of a UNIX-esque development environment. While the basic steps are the same for Windows/MS4W the commands included here will fail.* 

The developer quickstart can be found on `GitHub pages. <https://geomoose.github.io/gm3/quickstart.html>`_ This version is kept up to date with the latest development version of GeoMoose.
