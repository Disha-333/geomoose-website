GeoMoose Quickstart Guides
==========================

MS4W
----

Want to try GeoMoose on Windows without a lot of setup? Then checkout the `MS4W Quickstart. <https://geomoose.github.io/gm3/ms4w-quickstart/index.html>`_ It will walk you through installing MS4W and the GeoMoose MS4W package.

Linux
-----

Is Linux more your style?  Then checkout the `Deploying on EC2 Quickstart. <https://geomoose.github.io/gm3/quickstart-ec2.html>`_.  Although it focuses on deploying to EC2, most of the instructions apply to Linux in general.

OSGeo Live
----------

GeoMoose is on `OSGeo Live <https://live.osgeo.org/>`_. See the `OSGeo Live Quickstart. <https://live.osgeo.org/en/quickstart/geomoose_quickstart.html>`_ It will walk you through using GeoMoose on OSGeo Live.

Developer Quickstart
--------------------

*This version of the quickstart assumes use of a UNIX-esque development environment. While the basic steps are the same for Windows/MS4W the commands included here will fail.* 

The developer quickstart can be found on `GitHub pages. <https://geomoose.github.io/gm3/quickstart.html>`_ This version is kept up to date with the latest development version of GeoMoose.
